      <h2>Three N Problem</h2>
      <p>Problems in Computer Science are often classified as belonging to a certain class of problems (e.g., NP, Unsolvable,
        Recursive). In this problem you will be analyzing a property of an algorithm whose classification is not known for
        all possible inputs.</p>

      <h2>Bin Problem</h2>
      <p>Bin packing, or the placement of objects of certain weights into different bins subject to certain constraints, is
        an historically interesting problem. Some bin packing problems are NP-complete but are amenable to dynamic programming
        solutions or to approximately optimal heuristic solutions. In this problem you will be solving a bin packing problem
        that deals with recycling glass.

      <h2>Blocks Problem</h2>
      <p>Many areas of Computer Science use simple, abstract domains for both analytical and empirical studies. For example,
        an early AI study of planning and robotics (STRIPS) used a block world in which a robot arm performed tasks involving
        the manipulation of blocks.
